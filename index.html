<h1 style="color:blue;">Welcome to My Page!</h1>
<p>I am so new to this web page stuff. I am learning but mainly I've been trying to keep up! I need to get all of this html coding down so when I am adding stuff to this page, I can understand what I am doing. I am going to try to add a little bit of color and stuff to this page. Let's see how this goes!</p>

<h2 style="color:orange;">I want to add these items to my online sticker website:</h2>
	
<ol>
	<li>Links</li>	
	<li>Photos</li>
	<li>Social Media Stuff</li>
</ol>
	
<h3 style="color:green;"> These are my favorite things right now...</h3>

<ul>
	<li>My Planner</li>
	<Li>My New Ipad Pro</li>
	<Li>My Hydroflask</li>
</ul>
